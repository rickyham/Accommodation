<h1 class="left"> About Life Skill </h1>

<p> Life skill is located in the West Midlands providing people aged 16+ with individually tailored care pathways to independent living.</p>

<p> We enable young people who are leaving care to make the transition to independent living with the security of planned, consistent and 
comprehensive support.</p>

<p> There are many factors we take into consideration when young people are coming to stay with us; length of stay, the level of support required,
 training and employment, and individual budgets and benefits. Packages of support are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure 
that they remain proactive and purposeful.</p>

<p> Life skill will support young people within a range of accommodation including self-contained flats and small shared houses, helping 
them to develop the skills they need to live independently.</p>

<p> Properties are located in local communities ensuring easy access to local amenities such as schools, colleges, shops, libraries and public 
transport. All properties are fully furnished and maintained to a high standard.</p>
