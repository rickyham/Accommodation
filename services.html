<h1 class="left">Our Services</h1>

<p>We welcome young people who may be in their first steps of leaving care but also young people looking for short term crisis accommodation 
due to homelessness and family breakdowns.</p>

<p>Staff are available 24  hours per day in person or by telephone to support young people to complete specific targets in order to assess 
their level of independence needs. During their stay young people will learn about budgeting, shopping, cooking, washing, training or further 
education, getting a job, making and keeping appointments, paying bills, form filling, accessing services, talking to professionals and most
 importantly managing a home.</p>
