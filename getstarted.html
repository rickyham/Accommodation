	<h1 class="left"> Application Process </h1>
	<p> Life Skill will consider referrals from ALL Young People 
	and will assess each application on its own merits. </p>

	<p> Life Skill requires referring agencies to indicate clearly 
	the levels of support they deem appropriate to meet the needs of 
	the Young Person </p>

	<p> We request that we be provided with a recent Social History report 
	and Psychiatrist/Psychologist report (if applicable). </p>

	<p> You may download an application form as PDF and email back, 
	by clicking on the link, Once completed, it should be emailed 
	back.</p>

	<p> When this is done, we will arrange for a face to face meeting with 
	the Young Person, the Social Worker and our Manager to 
	determine the level of support needed.</p>

	<p> Should the Young Person wish to continue with the 
	application, a Placement Agreement will be sent out to the 
	Social Worker, and the Young Person will be sent a 
	placement acceptance form to sign, which highlights the 
	expectations required of them and details their 
	responsibilities.</p>

	<p> Once these are returned, we can move forward in finding suitable 
	accommodation.</p>
